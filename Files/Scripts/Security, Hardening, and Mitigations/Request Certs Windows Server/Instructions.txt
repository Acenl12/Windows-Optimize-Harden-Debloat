On the machine you are requesting a cert for, create a folder and move the
InitialRequest.txt to it. Change the information in the InitialRequest.txt
file on the subject line to reflect the FQDN of the server. Request the cert
by running the following command from the directory the InitialRequest.txt
is located:

"certreq.exe -new initialrequest.txt REDSXXXXXXXXXX.txt"

It will output a file in the folder it was run from. Send that file to me.
I'll send something back that will look something like this:
REDSXXXXXXXXXXX_CA.txt
When you get that, install the cert by running the following command:

"certreq.exe -accept REDSXXXXXXXXXXX_CA.txt"
